# Handling-Missing-Values
The analysis outlines two primary approaches for dealing with missing values: Complete case analysis and Imputation analysis using MICE and missForest. Stepwise Cox regression is applied to high-dimensional survival data with baseline and time-varying covariates. Frailty-adjusted Cox; without-frailty Cox PH models were fitted. A simulation study was conducted for generalizability.
The analyses were compared for imputed versus non-imputed datasets and the adjusted Cox models. 
## Project Objective
1. Impute dataset
2. Compare the imputation techniques
3. Compare the analyses for the imputed vs non-imputed datasets
4. Conduct a simulation study
## Dataset
The data (CAP004) used for this analysis was obtained from CAPRISA (https://www.caprisa.org/Pages/CAPRISAStudies).
